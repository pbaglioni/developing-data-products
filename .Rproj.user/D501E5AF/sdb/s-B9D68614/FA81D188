The assignment is geared toward ensuring the following concepts were well understood by the students\n\n- **shiny** to build data product application\n- **R-Presentation or slidify** to create data product related presentations\n\nThe Application\n========================================================\ntype: sub-section\nThe application developed for the first part of the assignment is called **Storm Database Analysis** and is avalilable at: \nhttps://pbaglioni.shinyapps.io/developing-data-products-shiny/\n\nThe application allows the user to:\n- Select the inputs like range of years or types of events. \n- Select the output to be displayed on the map, as a graph or as a table \n- Use the option to download the filtered data.\n\n\nThe Data\n========================================================\ntype: sub-section\nThis application is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.\n\nDataset should be obtained from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) and processed for the course project. This dataset is the same used for the Cousera's Reproducible Research Course.\n\nSource code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/pbaglioni/developing-data-products).\n\nData\n=====================\ntype: sub-section\nRead Data\n```{r}\nlibrary(data.table)\ndt <- fread('events.agg.csv')\nhead(dt)\n```\n\n\n\n",
